							Discord has improved over the years, adding new ways for bots and users to interact.

							the new features to <strong>improve the user experience</strong>.
						</p>
						<p>
							Discord Tickets uses <strong>slash</strong> and <strong>context menu</strong> commands,
							<strong>buttons</strong>, <strong>menus</strong>,
							and modal <strong>forms</strong>.

					<strong>There's more!</strong>
				</p>
				<p>
					Discord Tickets has lots of <strong>useful features</strong>,
					whilst steering clear of copying bloat or poor features from other bots.
					Many of the features are <strong>optional</strong>,
					so can be dialled down or completely disabled if you don't want them.
