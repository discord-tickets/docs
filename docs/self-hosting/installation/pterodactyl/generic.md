# Pterodactyl (generic egg)

!!! warning
	**If you are going to host Discord Tickets with a third-party hosting provider** rather than on your own server:

	-  You are more likely to encounter rate limits due to sharing an IP address with other Discord bots.
	-  If the hosting provider does not offer a reverse proxy service,
		you won't be able to use a domain name with SSL/TLS,
		which is strongly recommended.


Discord Tickets can be run with Pterodactyl using a [generic Node.js egg](https://github.com/parkervcp/eggs/tree/master/generic/nodejs).

Note that although the bot may use under 100-150MB of RAM (depending on the server size etc),
**NPM may crash when installing dependencies if less than 500MB is allocated.**

## Installation

Start by creating a new Node.js v20+ server.

1. Set the git repository to `https://github.com/discord-tickets/bot`
2. Set the branch to the latest tag, e.g. `v4.0.35`.
   You can find the latest tag at the top right corner of this page or [here](https://github.com/discord-tickets/bot/releases/latest).
3. Enable auto-updating so the startup script will download the code for you
4. Change the file to `src/index.js`

After starting the server for the first time, should see something like this.
Don't worry about the environment variable error yet.

## Environment variables

Go to the Files tab and open the `.env` file (start the server if it doesn't exist).

### Creating the Discord application

--8<-- "includes/discord-application"

### Database

If your host doesn't offer a MySQL/MariaDB database, set `DB_PROVIDER` to `sqlite`.

Otherwise, go to the Databases tab, create a new database, and copy the connection string.
If it starts with `jdbc:`, remove it.

```title="Example"
DB_CONNECTION_URL=mysql://u1533_nzSlNBSZvr:AryE.igrd7ULYQK8ANf%2Bw0V%5E@helsinki.dtickets.rocks:3306/s1533_tickets
DB_PROVIDER=mysql
```


### Web server

Find your server's port under "Address" on the Console page.

```title="Example"
HTTP_EXTERNAL=http://helsinki.dtickets.rocks:25500
HTTP_HOST=0.0.0.0
HTTP_PORT=25500
```

Or, if you are using a reverse proxy:

```title="Example"
HTTP_EXTERNAL=https://portal.dtickets.rocks
HTTP_HOST=0.0.0.0
HTTP_PORT=25500
```

### Other environment variables

The only other required non-default environment variables are `DB_PROVIDER`,
and `DB_CONNECTION_URL` if you are not using SQLite as your database.

--8<-- "includes/env.md"

## Publishing the commands

Start the server and wait until you see "Connected to Discord" in green.
Then type `commands publish` into the bot's console to publish the commands to Discord.

## Reverse proxy

If you have a domain name, you should [set up a reverse proxy](../../reverse-proxy.md) with SSL/TLS
and set the `HTTP_TRUST_PROXY` environment variable to `#!yaml true`.
