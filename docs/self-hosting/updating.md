# Updating

This guide is for updating between minor versions (e.g. 4.0 to 4.1).
If you are updating from the last major version (e.g. 3.x to 4.x), please refer to the [migration guide](https://blog.discordtickets.app/version-4-0/).

BACKUP, git fetch, checkout, npm install (migrate), check changelog instructions (config changes, etc.), restart, publish commands (links).

!!! example
	=== "SQLite"
		```bash linenums="1"
		mkdir ~/backup
		cp user/database.db{,-journal} ~/backup
		```

	=== "MySQL"
		```bash linenums="1"
		mysqldump -u <username> -p <database> | gzip > tickets.sql.gz
		```

	=== "PostgreSQL"
		```bash linenums="1"
		pg_dump -U <username> <database> | gzip > tickets.sql.gz
		```

## Docker

If you are running the container using docker-compose file, run the following commands :
```bash
docker pull eartharoid/discord-tickets:4.0
```
Once pull is done, simply run :

```bash
docker-compose up -d --force-recreate
```
to recreate the docker container with the latest image.

Alternatively, you can use [Watchtower](https://containrrr.dev/watchtower/) to do this automatically when an update is released, **Do not use the `latest` tag when automating updates** as major updates will break the bot.

## Standalone

## HypeSrv

Your HypeSrv installation of DiscordTickets (if done via the `Content Manager`) will automatically check for and perform updated on every (re-)start of your server.

HypeSrv doesn't currently offer a first-party solution for backing up a database server.
Instead, please connect to the database with an SQL Client like HeidiSQL and export your database via such a tool.


## Railway

Railway doesn't really offer a first-party solution for backing up a database server. Instead, follow the guide for their workaround to export your database to an AWS S3 bucket at https://blog.railway.app/p/automated-postgresql-backups

## Pterodactyl

Standard Pterodactyl doesn't offer a first-party solution for exporting or downloading databases. If your server host has an option to duplicate or download/export your database, do that. If not, you'll need to access your server hosts phpMyAdmin page. Contact them directly if you need help with doing this as we can't really help with this.

## PebbleHost

This guide assumes you're using a Bot hosting plan from PebbleHost and not a dedicated server, VPS or other service.

1) Locate your service on the game panel and go to the MySQL Database tab
