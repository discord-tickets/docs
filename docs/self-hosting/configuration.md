# Configuration

This page is about the global bot configuration.
For per-guild configuration, refer to the (other) [Configuration](../configuration/index.md) page.

!!! info
	Changes to environment variables or the main configuration file require a restart to take effect.
	If you aren't using a panel or other daemonisation method to run the bot,
	type `exit` or press ++ctrl+c++ a couple of times to kill the process.

## Environment variables

In most cases, the environment variables can be set by editing the `.env` file (which the bot creates for you if you follow the installation instructions).

The installation guides also explain where to find most of the environment variable values.

!!! danger
	Keep your environment variables safe.
	Your Discord `token` and `secret` are extremely dangerous in the wrong hands,
	and your database is useless if you lose the encryption key.
	These example values are fake; **do not share real values** (in version control, pastes, screenshots, etc).

!!! example
	```bash title=".env"
	DB_CONNECTION_URL="mysql://bots:VerySecurePassword123@localhost/tickets0"
	DB_PROVIDER=mysql
	DISCORD_SECRET=rUpDU2T8K4ZXie8kdpzYsMTLbUhvmBRd
	DISCORD_TOKEN=ODcwOTg1TY0NjI0NODI2Mzc0.DNg0e0.UYVof7V1v0kRA0HHtGwXKA3URxwANAZhQiA
	ENCRYPTION_KEY=445940dbed49eff55df56dd646fa1cb4b686df4cb9ac004a
	HTTP_EXTERNAL=https://tickets.example.com
	HTTP_HOST=0.0.0.0
	HTTP_INTERNAL=
	HTTP_PORT=8169
	HTTP_TRUST_PROXY=true
    INVALIDATE_TOKENS=
	OVERRIDE_ARCHIVE=
	PUBLIC_BOT=false
	PUBLISH_COMMANDS=false
	SUPER=319467558166069248
	```

### `DB_CONNECTION_URL`

<small>:octicons-question-16: Conditionally optional</small>

The MySQL or PostgreSQL database connection string.
If you are using SQLite, this is not required.

??? example
	=== "MySQL/MariaDB"
		```bash title=".env"
		DB_CONNECTION_URL="mysql://user:password@host:port/database"
		```
	=== "PostgreSQL"
		```bash title=".env"
		DB_CONNECTION_URL="postgresql://user:password@host:port/database"
		```
	=== "SQLite"
		```bash title=".env"
		DB_CONNECTION_URL=
		```

### `DB_PROVIDER`

The type of database the bot will use; one of:

- `#!yaml mysql` (recommended, use this for MariaDB too)
- `#!yaml postgresql`
- `#!yaml sqlite`

### `DISCORD_SECRET`

Your Discord application's secret key, used for OAuth2.
Follow the installation guides to find this.

### `DISCORD_TOKEN`

Your Discord application's authentication token.
Follow the installation guides to find this.

### `ENCRYPTION_KEY`

The key used for encrypting data in the database and signing JWTs (authentication cookies).

This is usually generated for you automatically.
You can also run `#!bash npm run keygen` to generate a new key,
or use this generator:

--8<-- "includes/encryption-key.html"

!!! danger
	**Keep this safe!**
	If someone manages to get access to your database (or a dump/backup) and they have the encryption key, your users' messages will be readable.
	Similarly, if you lose this key, you will need to completely reset the database.

### `HTTP_EXTERNAL`

<small>:material-factory: Default: `#!yaml http://127.0.0.1:8169`</small>

The full external URL used to access the bot's API or settings panel.

??? example
	```bash title=".env" linenums="6"
	HTTP_EXTERNAL=https://tickets.example.com
	```

### `HTTP_HOST`

<small>:material-factory: Default: `#!yaml 0.0.0.0`</small>

The interface that the integrated web server will listen on.
The default accepts connections from anywhere (assuming your firewall allows it).

### `HTTP_INTERNAL`

If unset, defaults to the [`HTTP_EXTERNAL`](#http_external){ data-preview } value.
This is the address that will be used when the bot (more specifically the integrated SvelteKit app) makes API requests to itself.
Usually, this should be the same as the external address, but in some cases, the external address can't be reached internally.

??? example
	```bash title=".env" linenums="9"
	HTTP_INTERNAL=https://tickets.example.com
	```

### `HTTP_PORT`

<small>:material-factory: Default: `#!yaml 8169`</small>

!!! inline end info "Info"
	Ports lower than 1024 may require running as root to bind to.

The port number that the integrated web server will bind to.

### `HTTP_TRUST_PROXY`

<small>
:octicons-question-16: Optional ·
:material-factory: Default: `#!yaml false`
</small>

If you are running the bot behind a reverse proxy, set this to `#!yaml true` (must be lowercase) to trust the `X-Forwarded-` headers.

### `INVALIDATE_TOKENS`

<small>:octicons-question-16: Optional</small>

A [timestamp](https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-date-time-string-format) (e.g. `2023-03-12T21:50:39.267Z`) which any [API service key](../api.md) (not user tokens) must be created after to be accepted.
If a service key is leaked, set this to the current time to invalidate all existing keys.

### `OVERRIDE_ARCHIVE`

<small>:octicons-question-16: Optional</small>

When set to `#!yaml false` (must be lowercase), guilds' `archive` setting will be ignored, disabling the archive feature for all guilds.

### `PUBLIC_BOT`

<small>
:octicons-question-16: Optional ·
:material-factory: Default: `false`
</small>

You should keep this as `#!yaml false`.

### `PUBLISH_COMMANDS`

<small>
:octicons-question-16: Optional ·
:material-factory: Default: `false`
</small>

When set to `#!yaml true` (must be lowercase), commands  will automatically be published to Discord.
Enabling this is not recommended if you are going to restart your bot frequently,
but it is useful for removing the need to publish the commands manually when you install or update the bot.

### `SUPER`

<small>
:octicons-question-16: Optional ·
:material-factory: Default: `#!yaml 319467558166069248`
</small>

A comma-separated list of Discord user IDs that have elevated privileges.
These users (typically the bot owners) are allowed to manage the settings of any guild, regardless of their roles or permissions in that guild.

!!! tip "Recommendation"
	If you keep the default (`#!yaml 319467558166069248`), I can help you without you needing to give me administrator permissions in your guild.
	You can also add your own ID:

	```bash title=".env" linenums="15"
	SUPER=319467558166069248{++,++}{==youruseridhere==}
	```

## Main configuration file

The main configuration file is located at `user/config.yml`.
If it doesn't exist, run the bot and it will be generated for you.

!!! example
	```yaml title="user/config.yml"
    logs:
      files:
        directory: ./logs
        enabled: true
        keepFor: 30
      level: info
    presence:
      activities:
        - name: /new
        - name: with {totalTickets} tickets
        - name: "{openTickets} tickets"
          type: 3
        - name: "{avgResponseTime} response time"
          type: 3
      interval: 20
      status: online
    stats: true
    templates:
      transcript: transcript.md
	```

### `logs`

#### `files`

##### `directory`

<small>:material-factory: Default: `#!yaml ./logs`</small>

The directory to store log files in, if log file are enabled.

##### `enabled`

<small>:material-factory: Default: `#!yaml true`</small>

If logs should be saved to files.
This is recommended but can be disabled if for example you are using a panel which already does this.

##### `keepFor`

<small>:material-factory: Default: `#!yaml 30`</small>

The number of days to keep log files for before deleting them (to save disk space), if log files are enabled.

#### `level`

<small>:material-factory: Default: `#!yaml info`</small>

The minimum log level that should be logged.

Must be one of:

- `#!yaml debug`
- `#!yaml verbose`
- `#!yaml info` (recommended)
- `#!yaml success`
- `#!yaml warn`
- `#!yaml notice`
- `#!yaml error`
- `#!yaml critical`

### `presence`

#### `activities`

An array of activities (length must be at least 1).

##### `name`

The activity name, which may contain these placeholders:

- `#!yaml {avgResolutionTime}`
- `#!yaml {avgResponseTime}`
- `#!yaml {guilds}`
- `#!yaml {openTickets}`
- `#!yaml {totalTickets}`

##### `type`

<small>
:octicons-question-16: Optional ·
:material-factory: Default: `#!yaml 0`
</small>

The activity type (playing, watching etc).

Types: <https://discord-api-types.dev/api/discord-api-types-v10/enum/ActivityType>.

#### `interval`

<small>:material-factory: Default: `#!yaml 20`</small>

The number of seconds to show each activity before rotating.

#### `status`

<small>:material-factory: Default: `#!yaml online`</small>

The bot's status, one of:

- `#!yaml online`
- `#!yaml idle`
- `#!yaml invisible`
- `#!yaml dnd`

### `stats`

<small>:material-factory: Default: `#!yaml true`</small>

If stats should be posted to the Discord Tickets StatsAPI.

[Terms of service](../terms.md) and [Privacy policy](../privacy.md) apply.

### `templates`

#### `transcript`

<small>:material-factory: Default: `#!yaml transcript.md`</small>

The (partial) name of the file, relative to `user/templates`, that contains the [Mustache](https://mustache.github.io/) template for text transcripts.
The actual file must have the `.mustache` file extension appended to the end of this name (`transcript.md` --> `transcript.md.mustache`).

The generated transcript file's type/extension comes from the second dot-separated segment of the file name,
so if you want users to download ` .log` or `.txt` file instead of `.md`,
you would change this option to `transcript.txt` and rename the file to `transcript.txt.mustache`.
