#### :material-ticket:{ .blue title="Tickets-only" } `Pin message`

Allows members that don't have manage messages permission to pin messages in their own tickets.
Pinned messages can be easily found later in archives. 

### Users

#### :material-headset:{ .orange title="Staff-only" } `Create a ticket for user`

Send a prompt (in the channel the command is used in) for the target user to create a ticket by clicking a button.
If you have multiple [categories](./index.md#concept:categories) configured,
the staff member will be asked to select the category that the ticket will be created in.

This can be used as an alternative to repeatedly asking members to "please create a ticket with [`/new`](#new)".
