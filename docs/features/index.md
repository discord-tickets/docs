## Concepts

[`Tickets`](#concept:tickets){ #concept:tickets }
:   A ticket is a channel where a member can have a private conversation with staff.

[`Categories`](#concept:categories){ #concept:categories }
:   Tickets are organised into categories that you create (such as ban appeals, staff applications, billing support etc).

	Since v4, ticket and Discord categories are separate.
	Multiple ticket categories can belong to a single Discord channel category.

[`Panels`](#concept:panels){ #concept:panels }
:   Unlike some other bots, panels are not a central concept in Discord Tickets.
	Tickets belong to categories, and a panel is one of several ways you can create a ticket.

[`Staff`](#concept:staff){ #concept:staff }
:	A staff member is any member who has at least 1 role that is assigned to any ticket category within the guild.


## Ticket creation

There are 5 ways to create a ticket:

- Using the [`/new`](./commands.md#new) command
- From a [message context menu](./commands.md#create-a-ticket-from-message)
- From a prompt sent by staff with a [user context menu](./commands.md#create-a-ticket-for-user)
- Using a button or select-menu on a panel
- Sending a direct message.

This flowchart shows the different pathways that can be taken to create a ticket:
