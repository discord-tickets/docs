	Over 90% of the questions asked in the support server have an answer on this website. **Please read the documentation** before rushing in and guessing how to install and configure your bot.

If you think you are capable you can install Discord Tickets on your own VPS (or [get hosting](#hosting-providers) if you don't have one), but **if you'd rather have your bot magically work without needing to install and host it, [get a managed bot](#managed-hosting).** A [managed bot](#managed-hosting) is the easiest way to get a Discord Tickets bot.

## Self hosting

Self hosting is recommended if you have experience with system administration. The standard and docker installation methods require a VPS or dedicated server.

- [Docker installation](/installation/docker)

### Hosting providers

#### PebbleHost

Discord Tickets is partnered with [PebbleHost](https://pebblehost.com/bot-hosting)[^1] to provide cheap bot hosting (including the database).

PebbleHost's preinstall feature does the first few installation steps for you. **This is the easiest way to install Discord Tickets if you want more control than a managed bot.** Click the logo below[^1] to get started.

#### VPS hosting

If you prefer a VPS, try one of these recommended hosts:

- [**Hetzner**](https://hetzner.cloud/?ref=6LDitpgQpB3V)[^1] - An affordable German VPS provider

## Managed hosting

If you just want a ticket bot without the complications of hosting and updating it, you can get [a managed bot](/managed) - meaning all of the hard work is done for you. Buy hosting directly from the creator of Discord Tickets to get your bot running with minimal effort.
