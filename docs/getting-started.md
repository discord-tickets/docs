	Over 90% of the questions asked in the support server have an answer on this website. **Please read the documentation** before rushing in and guessing how to install and configure your bot.

If you think you are capable you can install Discord Tickets on your own VPS (or [get hosting](#hosting-providers) if you don't have one), but **if you'd rather have your bot magically work without needing to install and host it, [get a managed bot](#managed-hosting).** A [managed bot](#managed-hosting) is the easiest way to get a Discord Tickets bot.

## Self hosting

Self hosting is recommended if you have experience with system administration. The standard and docker installation methods require a VPS or dedicated server.
