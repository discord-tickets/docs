# Getting started

	**Before you start:** this documentation took [the contributors](https://github.com/discord-tickets/docs/graphs/contributors) many hours to write.
	**Please read it**{ .red }, so we don't waste several more hours answering questions that can easily be avoided. :+1:

[^1]: Self-hosting difficulty depends on the hosting method chosen and most importantly, your experience
[^2]: It can take anywhere from 15 minutes to over 1 week for your bot to be ready, depending on availability, but it is typically ready within 12 hours
[^3]: Installation depends on your specific environment and may take longer if you encounter problems
[^4]: Pricing depends on the chosen hosting provider
[^5]: Installation-free methods still require bot configuration within your guild (unless you purchase the configuration service)
[^6]: Settings and archives are available at <https://portal.discordtickets.app>
[^7]: You can get a subdomain like `example.discordtickets.app` for free
[^8]: Optional, but strongly recommended
