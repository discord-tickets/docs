# Public bot

The public bot is completely free, requires no installation (because it's hosted), and can be added to as many servers as you want.

[Terms of service](./terms.md) and [privacy policy](privacy.md#service-privacy-policy) apply.

To get started:

1. [Login to the Discord Tickets Portal](https://portal.discordtickets.app/settings), then click the ":octicons-plus-16:&nbsp;Add" button
2. [Configure](configuration/index.md) your bot

[Login](https://portal.discordtickets.app/settings){ .md-button .md-button--primary }

# Beta Bot

There is also a beta version of Discord Tickets that has the same advantages as the main one but runs newer code. Your data can be migrated to and from the beta bot on request.

To get started:

1. [Login to the Discord Tickets PTB Portal](https://beta.dtickets.rocks/settings), then click the ":octicons-plus-16:&nbsp;Add" button
2. [Configure](configuration/index.md) your bot

[Login to Beta Bot](https://portal.discordtickets.app/settings){ .md-button .md-button--primary }

!!! danger
    The beta bot runs iterations of the bot which may not always be as stable as the public bot and may have adverse effects on your server. The bot will also go down more for updates and fixes.
