## FAQs

### Why are there two plans?

Both plans run the same code, the only difference is that archiving is disabled on the Basic plan.
This is because **the majority of storage costs are from archiving** (storing transcripts).
**If you aren't going to use this feature, your bot will be cheaper to host.**

!!! abstract ""
	£3/month is already quite cheap, especially considering you're paying for my time to manage the technical side so you don't have to.
	The Basic plan exists so **you can pay even less if you don't need the most expensive feature**.

### Which plan should I choose?

??? question "Do you need the archiving feature?"
	=== "Yes"
		Choose the **Professional** plan
	=== "No"
		Choose the **Basic** or the **Professional** plan

??? question "Do you have a domain name?"
	=== "Yes"
		Choose the **Professional** plan
	=== "No"
		Choose the **Basic** or the **Professional** plan

### Can my bot have a custom status/activity?

Yes, you can specify custom activities when you create a ticket.
Check [the documentation](./self-hosting/configuration.md#presence) for available placeholders.


### Can I edit the code?

No, you don't have access to the files or console. Everything is completely managed for you.
To keep administration easy, and for security, every bot instance runs identical code.

If you want more flexibility, consider [self-hosting](../self-hosting/) with a [recommended hosting provider](../self-hosting/#hosting-providers).

!!! tip
    The exception to this is that you can provide a custom locale file to further customise the bot's messages.
