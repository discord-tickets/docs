# Pterodactyl installation

For the best experience, import the [Discord Tickets egg](https://github.com/discord-tickets/bot/blob/main/pterodactyl.egg.json). If you are not an administrator and your host does not want to add this, the common "discord.js generic" and "node.js" eggs should also work.


1. [Create your Discord bot application](/getting-your-bot-token)
2. [Add your bot to Discord](/invite-url-generator)
