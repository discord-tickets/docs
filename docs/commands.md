Get the transcript of a ticket.

To optimise the experience for normal members, this command works in a slightly inconvenient way for staff members.

To get the transcript of another member's ticket, select the `/transcript` command,

1. Press ++arrow-right++ (right-arrow, or just click in the empty space) to escape the `ticket` option,
2. Select the `member`.
3. Click back in the `ticket` option field and start typing to search that member's tickets.

Note that the autocomplete response is cached by the app, so you will not see suggestions until you type.
