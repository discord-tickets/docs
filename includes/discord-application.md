!!! warning
	Don't skip this section if you already know how to create a Discord application;
	Discord Tickets requires additional configuration.
	Using an existing application is not recommended.

1. Go to the [Discord Developer Portal :octicons-link-external-16:](https://discord.com/developers/applications){ target="_blank" rel="noopener external" }

2. Create an application

	1. Click the `New Application` button
	2. Give your application a name, accept the terms of service and click `Create`

3. In the page that appears you can add a logo, description, or links to your terms of service and privacy policy if you wish to, and then click `Save Changes`.

4. Go to the `OAuth2` page and click `Reset Secret`, then `Yes, do it!`.
	**Copy the new secret and set it as your `DISCORD_SECRET` environment variable.**

5. Click `Add Redirect` and enter the value of your `HTTP_EXTERNAL` environment variable, followed by `/auth/callback`.
	Then click `Save Changes`.

	!!! example "Examples"
		- `http://12.345.67.89:8080/auth/callback`
		- `https://tickets.example.com/auth/callback`

    If you set this to `https://tickets.example.com/auth/callback`,
    your `HTTP_EXTERNAL` environment variable must be set to `https://tickets.example.com` *(without a trailing `/`)*.

6. Navigate to the `Bot` page

	1. Click `View Token`, then **copy the token and set it as your `DISCORD_TOKEN` environment variable.**
	2. We highly recommend disabling the "Public Bot" option to prevent other people from adding your bot to their servers. Before you can do so, you will need to go to to the `Installation` page and set `Install Link` to `None`. After saving changes, return to the `Bot` page and disable the "Public Bot" option.

	3. **Enable the `presence`, `server members` and `message content` intents.**

Don't add the bot to your Discord server yet; you'll do that later.
